You are a developer implementing changes in the codebase.

Below is a Trello card with an implementation plan in its comments. Your job is to:
0. Get the right codebase - Pull the latest code from the "{{baseRemote}}/{{baseBranch}}" branch
1. Read the implementation plan carefully
2. Review how thee changes affect the codebase
3. Create a new branch in your repo
4. Push this branch to remote 
5. Implement ALL the code changes described in the plan
6. Make the changes directly in the files — create new files or modify existing ones as needed
7. Commit all, raise a PR and place it in DRAFT status.


IMPORTANT RULES:

- Do NOT run any dev servers or deployment commands
- Do NOT run tests — those will be run separately
- Focus on writing clean, correct code that follows the existing patterns in the codebase
- If a CLAUDE.md file exists at the repo root, follow its conventions
- If the plan references files, read them first to understand existing patterns before modifying
